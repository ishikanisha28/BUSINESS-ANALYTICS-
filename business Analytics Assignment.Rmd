## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#1 Showing  the breakdown of the number of transactions by countries i.e. how many transactions are 
in the dataset for each country (consider all records including cancelled transactions). Showing this 
in total number and also in percentage. Showing only countries accounting for more than 1% of the 
total transactions. 

```{r}
Assign %>%
group_by(Country)%>%
summarise(trans =n())%>%
mutate(percent=(trans/541909)*100)%>% #541909 is number of observation
filter(TT1 <- percent >1)
```

#2 Creation of a new variable ‘TransactionValue’ that is the product of the exising ‘Quantity’ and 
‘UnitPrice’ variables
```{r}
Assign <- mutate(Assign, "TransactionValue"=TransactionValue <-Assign$Quantity * Assign$UnitPrice)
```
#cross cheacking if the new variable is formed
```{r}
summarize(Assign)
colnames(Assign)
```
library(zoo)

#3 showing  the  breakdown of  transaction  values 
by countries, total sum of transaction values and countries with total transaction exceeding 130,000 British Pound. 

```{r}
Assign%>%
group_by(Country)%>%
summarise(TSTV = sum(TransactionValue))%>%
filter(TSTV>130000)

#5 histogram of Transaction values from Germany
```{r}

#6 Customer with highest number of transaction is CustomerID =17841, CustomerTransaction 7983
```{r}
TRAN<- Assign %>%
group_by(CustomerID)%>%
summarise(CustomerTransaction = n())%>%
filter(CustomerID != "NA")%>%

#7Calculating  the  percentage  of  missing  values  for  each  variable  in  the  dataset using colMeans()

```{r}
Missing_Value<-colMeans(is.na(Assign))
```
```{r}
print(Missing_Value)
```
#As only customerID has missing values So its value in percentage
`````{r}
print(Missing_Value['CustomerID']*100)
```
#8 the number oftransactions with missing CustomerID recordsby countries is
```{r}
Assign%>%
group_by(Country)%>%
filter(is.na(CustomerID))%>%
summarise(NMCT=n())
```

10. The return rate for  the French customers, considering all the factors is 
 
```{r}
RRV<-nrow(Assign%>%
group_by(CustomerID)%>%
filter((Country=='France')&(TransactionValue<0)&(CustomerID != 'Na')))
French_CX<-nrow(Assign%>%
group_by(CustomerID)%>%
filter((Country=='France')&(CustomerID != 'Na')))

#11.What is the product that has generated the highest revenue for the retailer? (i.e.  item with the 
highest total sum of ‘TransactionValue’). (10 marks) 
```{r}
CC<-Assign%>%
group_by(Description,StockCode)%>%
summarise(n=sum(TransactionValue))%>%
arrange(desc(n))
TT<- CC[CC['n']==max(CC['n']),]
print(TT$Description)# highest Revenue
print(TT$StockCode)#Stock Code
```

#12  The number of unique customers that are represented in the dataset using unique() and length() functions is 4373
```{r}
length(unique(Assign$CustomerID))
```
####     EXTRA POINTS

#4 #4This  is  an  optional question which carries  additional marks  (golden  questions). In  this  question, 
we are dealing with the InvoiceDate variable. The variable is read as a categorical when you read 
data  from  the  file.  Now  we  need  to  explicitly  instruct  R  to  interpret  this  as  a  Date  variable. 
"POSIXlt" and "POSIXct" are two powerful object classes in R to deal with date and time. Click here 
for more information.  First let’s convert ‘InvoiceDate’ into a POSIXlt object: 
Now,let’s convert ‘InvoiceDate’ into a POSIXltobject:
```{r}
CNVT=strptime(Assign$InvoiceDate,format='%m/%d/%Y %H:%M',tz='GMT')
head(CNVT)
```
#requirements to solve
```{r}
Assign$NID<-as.Date(CNVT)
Assign$IWD<-weekdays(Assign$NID)
Assign$NIH<-as.numeric(format(CNVT,"%H"))
Assign$NIM<-as.numeric(format(CNVT,"%H"))
head(Assign)
```
#a Showing the percentage of transactions (by numbers) by days of the week 
```{r}
Assign%>%
group_by(IWD)%>%
tally(sort=TRUE)%>%
 summarise(IWD,TransactionNum=n,Percentage= n/sum(n)*100)%>%
 arrange(desc(TransactionNum))
 
 #b Showing  the  percentage  of  transactions  (by  transaction  volume)  by  days  of  the  week 
 
 Assign%>%
 group_by(NIH)%>%
 summarise(Sum_trans=sum(TransactionValue))%>%
 mutate(Percentage_trans=Sum_trans*100/sum(Sum_trans))
 
 #c Showing the percentage of transactions (by transaction volume) by month of the year 

Assign%>%
group_by(NIM)%>%

mutate(Percentage_trans_month=Sum_trans_month*100/sum(Sum_trans_month))
 
 #d What was the date with the highest number of transactions from Australia? (Date= 6/15/2011 13:37   n=139)

 #eThe  company  needs  to  shut  down the  website  for  two  consecutive  hours  for  maintenance. 
#What would be the hour of the day to start this so that the distribution is at minimum for the 
#customers? The responsible IT team is available from 7:00 to 20:00 every day.(NIH=7 n=383 is the minimum derived from the table)

Assign%>%
group_by(NIH)%>%
tally(sort=TRUE)%>%
filter(NIH>=7 & NIH<=20)

```
#9 On average, how often the costumers comeback to the website for their next shopping? (i.e. what 
is  the  average  number  of  days  between  consecutive  shopping)  (Optional/Golden  question:  18 
additional  marks!)  Hint:  1.  A  close  approximation  is  also  acceptable  and  you  may  find  diff() 
function useful. 
```{r}
CC<-Assign%>%
group_by(CustomerID)%>%
summarise(DIC= diff(NID))%>%
  filter(DIC>0)
print(mean(CC$DIC))
```
